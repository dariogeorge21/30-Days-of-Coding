# Sets Using Python **Day 9**

Hello Team,
This folder contains beginner-friendly Python programming exercises designed to help you master the fundamental operations and functionalities of Python sets.

## Questions

### **1. Add Elements to a Set**
Write a Python program to create a set and add elements to it.  
- Example Input: `Add elements 5, 10, 15 to the set.`  
- Example Output: `{5, 10, 15}`

---

### **2. Remove an Element from a Set**
Create a program to remove an element from a set if it exists.  
- Example Input: `Set: {1, 2, 3, 4}, Remove: 3`  
- Example Output: `{1, 2, 4}`

---

### **3. Union, Intersection, and Difference**
Write a program to find the union, intersection, and difference between two sets.  
- Example Input: `Set A: {1, 2, 3}, Set B: {3, 4, 5}`  
- Example Output:  
  - Union: `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`  
  - Intersection: `{3}`  
  - Difference (A - B): `{1, 2}`  

---

### **4. Subset Check**
Check if a set is a subset of another set.  
- Example Input: `Set A: {1, 2}, Set B: {1, 2, 3}`  
- Example Output: `True` (Set A is a subset of Set B)

---

### **5. Symmetric Difference**
Write a program to find the symmetric difference of two sets.  
- Example Input: `Set A: {1, 2, 3}, Set B: {3, 4, 5}`  
- Example Output: `{1, 2, 4, 5}`
