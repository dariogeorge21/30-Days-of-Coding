Hello Team,
This file contains a collection of Python questions focusing on the use of the `for` loop. These questions are to enhance your understanding of iterative logic in Python.

## Questions


1. **Write a program to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 50 using a `for` loop**

3. **Write a program to reverse a string using a `for` loop.**  

Input : Python
Output: nohtyP
Hint: Use `len()` in for iteration condition

4. **Write a Python program that iterates using `for` loop over a list of integers and prints "Even" for even numbers and "Odd" for odd numbers.**  

Input: 1234 [Every number gets convert into list. Hint: use `list(input())`]
Output: Odd
        Even

5. **Create a program to count the number of words in a sentence using a `for` loop**  

The sentence is asked by user in the form of a string. The string is splited into words by removing spaces and converted to list. (hint: use `split()` function). Then the list is iterated using for loop and finally prints the number of words.

### Example:
**Python is really easy** 
### No of words: 4
