# Python NumPy **Day 16**

This folder contains a list of Python programming questions for **numpy module**. Each question includes a hint to help you get started.

### Questions

---

1. **Array Creation**  
   How do you create a NumPy array from a Python list, and how do you specify the data type of the array?

---

2. **Array Operations**  
   Given two NumPy arrays `a = np.array([1, 2, 3])` and `b = np.array([4, 5, 6])`, how can you perform element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division?

---

3. **Array Reshaping**  
   How do you reshape a 1D NumPy array `arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])` into a 2D array with 2 rows and 3 columns?

---

4. **Array Indexing and Slicing**  
   Given the NumPy array `arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])`, how can you access the element in the second row and third column? How can you slice the array to get the first two rows and all columns?

---

5. **Statistical Functions**  
   How can you calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of a NumPy array `arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])`?

Feel free to attempt these problems and refer to the hints if you get stuck!
Thankyou and have a nice day!!
