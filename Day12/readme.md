## Questions


1. **Write a program to print diamond pattern using a `for` loop**

 ### Pattern :      
                 *
                ***
               *****
              *******
               *****
                ***
                 *

It must be a diamond pattern

2. **Write a program to print Pyramid pattern using a `for` loop**

 ### Pattern :      
 
                       1 
                      121
                     12321 
                    1234321
                     12321
                      121
                       1  
                
It must be a diamond pattern with numbers
