# Tuples Using Python **Day 9**

Hello Team,
This folder contains user-friendly Python programming exercises focused on **tuples**. These exercises are designed to help you practice and understand tuple operations in Python. 

--- 
  
## Questions  

### 1. Merge and Sort Tuples  
Write a program to merge two tuples `(1, 2, 3)` and `(4, 5, 6)`, and then sort the resulting tuple in descending order.  

### 2. Count Occurrences in a Tuple  
Count the number of occurrences of each element in the tuple `(1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5)`.  

### 3. Sum of Elements in a Nested Tuple  
Given the tuple `t = ((1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6))`, write a program to calculate the sum of all the elements.  

### 4. Convert Tuple to Nested List  
Convert the tuple `(10, 20, 30, 40)` into a list inside list where each list contains the value with its index.
 - Example : `(1,2,3,4)`
 - Output : `([[1,0],[2,1],[3,2],[4,3]])`  

### 5. Remove Duplicates from a Tuple  
Write a program to remove all duplicate elements from the tuple `(1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5)` and return a new tuple.
