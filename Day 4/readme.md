# While Loop Using Python **Day 4**

Hello Team,
This file contains a collection of Python questions focusing on the use of the `while` loop. These questions are to enhance your understanding of iterative logic in Python.

## Questions


1. **Print Even Numbers from N to 1**  
   Write a program to print all even numbers between \(N\) and 1, where \(N\) is input by the user.

---

2. **Sum of Digits**  
   Write a program to find the sum of the digits of a number entered by the user using a `while` loop.
   
---

3. **Reverse a Number**  
   Write a program to reverse a number entered by the user using a `while` loop.  
   *(e.g., Input: 123, Output: 321)*

---

4. **Count Digits in a Number**  
    Write a program to count the number of digits in a number entered by the user.

---

5. **Armstrong Numbers in a Range**  
    Write a program to find all Armstrong numbers between two numbers entered by the user. Use a `while` loop to check each number.


Armstrong numbers (also known as narcissistic numbers) are numbers that are equal to the sum of their own digits, each raised to the power of the number of digits in the number.

### Example:

**153** is an Armstrong number because:

\[
1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153
\]

Thus, 153 is an Armstrong number.

### OR

5. **Check Palindrome Number**  
    Write a program to check if a number is a palindrome (i.e., reads the same backward as forward) using a `while` loop.

Thankyou and have a nice day.
